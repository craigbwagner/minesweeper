        <p> After clicking one of these squares, some of the squares will disappear, some will remain blank, and some will have numbers on them.
            These numbers correspond with the number of mines in the surrounding 8 squares. Use the numbers to figure out which of the blank
            squares have mines and which are safe to click. Right click to mark a square suspected to have a mine with an X. You win by revealing all squares that don't have mines in them.</p>
